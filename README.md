# K-Means Clustering & Image Compression

This repository showcases a personal project exploring the K-Means clustering algorithm and its practical applications, including image compression.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main tasks:

1. **Basic K-Means Clustering (H1P2T1_kmeans.ipynb)**  
   This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch. It covers fundamental concepts such as:
   - Initializing centroids
   - Assigning points to clusters
   - Updating centroids
   - Visualizing clustering results
   
2. **K-Means Image Compression (H1P2T2_kmeans_compression.ipynb)**  
   This bonus task applies K-Means clustering for image compression, reducing the number of colors in an image while preserving its visual quality. It's a practical example of how clustering can be used for data compression in real-world applications.

## Key Features

- Hands-on implementation of K-Means clustering algorithm
- Visualizations to better understand how the algorithm works
- Practical application of K-Means for image compression
- Jupyter notebooks for easy exploration and modification

## Motivation

This project was developed to deepen my understanding of clustering algorithms, particularly K-Means, and to experiment with its applications beyond theoretical examples. By applying K-Means to image compression, I aimed to explore how machine learning can be used for efficient data processing and optimization tasks.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kmeans-clustering-compression.git
   ```
2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks and run the cells to see the K-Means clustering algorithm in action.

## Future Improvements

- Exploring different clustering techniques such as DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering
- Optimizing the K-Means algorithm for larger datasets
- Extending the project to support additional image formats and higher-resolution compression

---

This project serves as a practical exploration of machine learning techniques and demonstrates the potential of K-Means clustering in both academic and real-world contexts.
